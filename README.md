Team: Arlette Varela, Nathan Bolt, Alexandra Taft, Anthony English

PROJECT SUMMARY:
For this project, we created a website that displays superhero and villain information from multiple universes. We also created a battle section that allows you to pick between two fighters and see who would win based on their stats.

We accessed the superhero database api listed above and loaded the json data into a mongo database. We created a website utilizing html, javascript, and css and used python and flask to connect the front end to the back end.


WEBSITE AND METHODOLOGY
The website has the following components:
Dashboard: Displays the selected characters alignment, powers, bio, hair color, gender, and other information.
Character Search: Displays stats like power, intelligence, and speed.
Battle Royale: Select two characters to battle to determine a winner.

LANDING PAGE
The website is a one page site with a navigation bar that will navigate the user to each section.
